# What are chat reactions?:

Chat reactions are events in which multiple individuals compete to type a word the fastest. They can spawn randomly from the bot or be initiated as a duel (`$cr duel`).

## Example of a chat reaction:

**winners**

🥇Ayestk in `1.89s`

🥈Scarlett in `2.73s`

🥉M.axz in `3.42s`


# leaderboards

Server leaderboards track stats for your servers only. You can access this with `$cr lb`


🏆 Overall: Total amount of wins combining all the placements (not including speed)

🥇 First: Most amount of wins for first place in a chat reaction.

🥈 Second: Most amount of wins for second place in a chat reaction.

🥉 Third: Most amount of wins for third place in a chat reaction.

🏎️ Speed: Fastest time a word has been typed in a random chat reaction. 

(Speed statistics are only affected by **randomly started chat reactions**. To view the leaderboard
you can do `$top cr/daily (global).`)

*When you get a new leaderboard position, Nypsi will notify you with a message in the chat*


## resetting server leaderboards

To reset your server's leaderboards, use `$cr stats reset`

**These stats can be reset by server admins at any time and are not related to anything outside of the
server.**
