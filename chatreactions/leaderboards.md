# what are chat reactions?

chat reactions are events in which multiple individuals compete to type a word the fastest. they can spawn randomly from the bot or be initiated as a duel (`$cr duel`).

# leaderboards

server leaderboards track stats for your servers only. you can access this with `$cr lb`.

🏆 overall: total amount of wins combining all the placements (not including speed).

🥇 first: most amount of wins for first place in a chat reaction.

🥈 second: most amount of wins for second place in a chat reaction.

🥉 third: most amount of wins for third place in a chat reaction.

🏎️ speed: fastest time a word has been typed in a random chat reaction.

(speed statistics are only affected by **randomly started chat reactions**. to view the leaderboard, you can do `$top cr/daily (global)`.)

*when you get a new leaderboard position, nypsi will notify you with a message in the chat.*

## resetting server leaderboards

to reset your server's leaderboards, use `$cr stats reset`.

**these stats can be reset by server admins at any time and are not related to anything outside of the server.**
